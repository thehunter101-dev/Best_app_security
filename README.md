# Project Name: proy_clinico

## Project Description

This project appears to be a clinical management system, likely for managing patient data, doctor information, and possibly appointments or other clinical workflows.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Django structure:

- \`manage.py\`: The command-line utility for interacting with this Django project.
- \`proy_clinico/\`: The main project directory.
  - \`settings.py\`: Contains the project's settings, including database configuration, installed apps, middleware, etc.
  - \`urls.py\`: The main URL configuration for the project. Routes defined here will direct requests to the appropriate applications.
  - \`wsgi.py\`: Configuration for running the project as a WSGI application.
  - \`asgi.py\`: Configuration for running the project as an ASGI application (for asynchronous features).
- \`applications/\`: This directory contains the individual Django apps that make up the project.
  - \`core/\`: Likely contains core models and functionality shared across the project or essential for its basic operation.
  - \`doctor/\`: An application specifically for managing doctor-related information and functionalities.
  - \`security/\`: An application dedicated to handling security aspects, such as user authentication, permissions, and possibly session management.
- \`templates/\`: Contains the HTML templates used by the Django views to render pages.
  - \`base.html\`: A base template that other templates likely extend, providing a common layout.
  - \`fragments/\`: Likely contains reusable HTML snippets included in other templates.
  - \`security/\`: Templates specific to the 'security' application.
- \`theme/\`: This application seems to be responsible for the project's theme and static files.
  - \`static/\`: Contains compiled static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) ready for deployment.
  - \`static_src/\`: Contains the source static files (e.g., raw CSS, JavaScript before processing/minification).
  - \`templates/\`: May contain theme-specific template overrides or base templates.
- \`dependencias.txt\`: Lists the project's Python dependencies. It's good practice to use a requirements.txt file instead for pip compatibility.

## Setup and Running the Project (General Django Steps)

These are general instructions based on a typical Django project structure. Specific steps might vary.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    \`\`\`

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    \`\`\`bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    \`\`\`

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's common to use a \`requirements.txt\` file. If \`dependencias.txt\` serves this purpose:
    \`\`\`bash
    pip install -r dependencias.txt
    \`\`\`
    (It's recommended to rename \`dependencias.txt\` to \`requirements.txt\` for convention).

4.  **Apply database migrations:**
    \`\`\`bash
    python manage.py migrate
    \`\`\`

5.  **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**
    \`\`\`bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    \`\`\`

6.  **Run the development server:**
    \`\`\`bash
    python manage.py runserver
    \`\`\`

The application should then be accessible at \`http://127.0.0.1:8000/\`.
