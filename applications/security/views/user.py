# To make this fully functional, you would also typically have:
# - UserListView (referenced by success_url)
# - UserCreateView
# - UserDeleteView
# - UserDetailView
# - Corresponding templates for list and detail.
# - URL patterns for all these views.

# For now, only UserUpdateView is implemented as per the immediate requirement.
# A placeholder user_list URL will be added, but the view itself is not implemented here.
# A simple user form template 'security/users/form.jinja' will also be needed.
